# Portfolio

## Description 

Welcome to my first developer portfolio! I designed a responsive web site to show off the different projects I have been working on. I used Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio. Feel free to take a look at how I applied Bootstrap classes and components to my website.

Thanks!
